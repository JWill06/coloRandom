## Challenges/Wins
We faced quite a few obstacles throughout the development of this app. The first hurdle was accomplishing the code for random hex-code generation. That allowed us to save those codes into an array that should be displayed as the boxes you see. Probably the greatest challenge of the product was producing the Saved Palettes section to spec. We faced quite the uphill battle for awhile, but after a few breaks and some deliberation, we achieved our goal. To see the arrays displayed on the right side of the page to spec was a truly wonderful feeling. 
   Our teamwork was what made the project so smooth. Dedication to beat the deadline drove us all past our initial limits, but when we worked together, it was collaborative and productive. When one team member was unable to work on the project, the others stepped in. We did work separately and together, and we're proud of our product.
